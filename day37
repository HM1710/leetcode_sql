DELETE vs TRUNCATE

DELETE is a DML statement whereas, TRUNCATE is a DDL statement.

DELETE can be used to remove all records from a table or to remove records based on certain criteria specified in the WHERE clause.
DELETE statement removes record one by one and also logs every entry into the log.

TRUNCATE can be used to remove all records from a table.
Truncate removes records by deallocating pages and it does not log each entry like DELETE (and because of this reason TRUNCATE is faster than DELETE statement).
We cannot specify any criteria (WHERE clause) with the TRUNCATE statement.
