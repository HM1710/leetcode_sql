What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL?

Ans: UNION and UNION ALL are used to concatenate two or more result sets into one meaning we can write multiple SELECT statements and then combine them into a unified set. 
The key difference between them is that UNION only keeps unique records whereas, UNION ALL keeps all records including duplicates.
